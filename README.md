🔐 Password Encryption System using Fernet
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates secure password encryption and decryption using Fernet symmetric encryption from the cryptography library in Python.

It allows users to:

🔒 Encode (encrypt) passwords

🔓 Decode (decrypt) passwords

🛡️ Securely store sensitive information

The project ensures that passwords are not stored in plain text and are protected using strong cryptographic techniques.

🚀 Technologies Used

🐍 Python 3.x
